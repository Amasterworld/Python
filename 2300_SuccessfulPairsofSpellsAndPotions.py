2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions

You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.


Example 1:

Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
Output: [4,0,3]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
Example 2:

Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. 
- 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful. 
Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.

SOLUTION: this problem can easily be solved if we use two for loop nested 
like this : for spell in spells:
                for potion in potions:
                    if spell * potion >= success:
                        cnt += 1
                ans.append(cnt)
            return ans;
O(n*m) where n and m are length of spell in potions, repectively.

->optimize the solution: sort the potions . potions.sort(reverse = True) from highest value to smallest value

for i in range(n)
    j = 0
    while j < m and spell[i] * potions[j] >= success:
        j += 1
    ans.append(j)
this approach is little better, because potions vector/list is sorted when whenevr spell[i] * postion[j] < success
->Stop and appendto ans
but  is  TLE (Time limited Exceed )

So, need to optinmize more, now we see:
after sorting the potions array, sorted_postions = [5,4,3,2,1] ,spell = [5,1,3], success = 7
spell[0] = 5, success/spell[0] = 7/5 = 1.4, that mean sorted_postions[j] >= 2 (because they are interger numbers, hecen 1.4->2)
is what we must count or know how many sorted_postions[j] >= 2. now the problem will be binary search:
given an number and return the most left idx thatÂ satisfies the given condtion.
in the above example, if we know the the most left idx that position[idx] >=2 is 1 hence we only need to calculate
len(positions) - idx = 5-1 = 4. 4 number in positions can be >= success.
now how to determine index of the valid_num, valid_num =  success/spell[i]? unfortunately, it is not correct answer, 
as we see, valid_num is an interger number, so we need to round up it to the closest interger. so we need to adding
spell[i] - 1, then valid_num = (success + spell[i] - 1)/spell[i] to ensure that the index is always rounded up to the nearest integer. 

when we get the valid_num only need to put it in the binary search function for positions to get its index
